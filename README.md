### Welcome / Karibu
I'm a Software Engineer/Developer (whichever floats your ⛵ ) that's passionate about learning and building things that bring value to people. Overtime I've worked on a range of things and the repos you'll find here reflect that. Apart from personal projects, there some educational/instructional repos for when I teach web dev at boot camps. 

When I'm not coding, I'm most probably working on my other creative interests (dance, music, poetry, etc). A few years back, a couple friends and I co-founded [Fuse Fam Collective](https://www.fusefam.com/) 🎭 .

### Some About Me's for You to Know

📍 I'm currently located in Amsterdam, NL.

🔭 I’m currently working on:
 - A Proof Of Concept (POC) for a Learning Management System made with Node.js & HBS, check it out [here](https://github.com/reMRKableDev/OnLearn).
 - An online tool for SoloPreneurs to start and run their businesses effectively (still in design phase).
 - An interactive map to help people see Amsterdam in a different light (working on POC currrently), check it out [here](https://github.com/reMRKableDev/a-livestory).

🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript.

🥅  My goals for the upcoming year are: 
 - To finish off the projects I've started on.
 - To contribute more to Open Source Projects (still a bit intimidated by this to be honest 😋 ).
 - To have more proficiency in TypeScript.

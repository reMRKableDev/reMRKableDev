### Welcome / Karibu
I'm a Software Engineer/Developer (whichever floats your ⛵ ) that's passionate about learning and building things that bring value to people. Overtime I've worked on a range of things and the repos you'll find here reflect that. Apart from personal projects, there some educational/instructional repos for when I teach web dev at boot camps. 

📍 I'm currently located in Amsterdam, NL

🔭 I’m currently working on:
 - A Proof Of Concept (POC) for a Learning Management System made with Node.js & HBS, check it out [here](https://github.com/reMRKableDev/OnLearn)
 - An online tool for SoloPreneurs to start and run their businesses effectively (still in design phase)
 - An interactive map to help people see Amsterdam in a different light (working on POC currrently), check it out [here](https://github.com/reMRKableDev/a-livestory)

When I'm not coding, I'm probably working on my creative interests (dance, music, poetry, etc) 🎭
